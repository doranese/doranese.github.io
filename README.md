## Goal
My goal for this project is to make a language using as few latin-based letters as possible and then move it to a completely different script, with an even more efficient writing system. This is not for an assignment or anything alike. I simply want to do this for my own enjoyment. If you plan on helping me document parts of the project, please contact me with some sort of resum√©, or any proof that you at least kind of know what your doing. Thank you!<br/>-G
